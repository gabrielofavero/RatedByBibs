# Rated! By Bibs

A quick way to rate your favorite content and share it to social network 😁

Development made by Bibs [me!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielfavero/) using plain HTML, CSS and JS. My original plan was to share it as an Instagram Stories native sticker, but since it requires an API that can only be used in mobile apps, this version generates an image canvas that you can export to your favorite social network. I might do a native mobile version in the future for that, but no promises!

Design made by [Guilherme Machado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-machado-1797a31bb/). You can find his Figma template [here](https://www.figma.com/design/pAblSLtZEBadSkxbuGNwB5/Rated--by-bibs?node-id=0-1&t=mz8OdJOHVDZHonEO-1).
